# Final Project

The general premise of the final project for this class is that is
supposed to showcase some aspects of the techniques we discussed.

Given the far-reaching extent of what can be considered ‘messy data
analysis’, you could focus on any one of these aspects. Examples of
potential routes your project could cover are:

1.  **Create a tidy dataset** from one or more (messy) sources.
    Document (a) the provenance of the data, (b) the tidying
    process, (c) the tidy data, and (d) make the data available, and (e)
    document a good use case.

2.  **Solve a problem** by starting with a motivating question.
    Document (a) data sources suitable for answering the question, (b)
    the data collection process, (c) the tidying process, (d) the
    suitability of the analysis, and (e) make your analytic writeup
    available together with the documentation necessary for reproducing
    the results.

3.  **Assess an analytic tool** using a simulation. Document (a) the
    theoretical basis, (b) the (tidy) simulation setup under various
    scenarios, (c) an in-depth analysis of the results. (d) Discuss
    potential alternatives and limitations, and (e) make your writeup
    available together with code and documentation for reproducing the
    results.

As an individual or in a team pick a topic and

1.  work on a topic of your choice
2.  publish your analysis and findings
3.  create a video highlighting your work

There are multiple submission stages for the project:

## Choice of Topic

Create a file `topic.qmd` that includes

1.  a motivation of your topic,
2.  a description of your plan of work. Please provide as much detail as
    you can,
3.  a team name and a list of all members on your team

For the submission, push the file `topic.qmd` to the github repository
and include a submission link in Canvas.

## Draft

Create a file `draft.qmd` that includes all of the items of the Choice
of Topic (potentially in a different order). Change the Plan of work to
an outline and fill in details. For any code chunk decide, whether you
want to show the code (that should happen sparingly). Provide comments
in the code about what each code chunk is supposed to do. Describe and
interpret results. Include visuals (not so sparingly :))

For the submission, push the file `draft.qmd` to the github repository
and include a submission link in Canvas.

## Final writeup/show

For the final work, create a file `index.qmd`. Make sure that this file
renders its output into a folder called `docs`.

Use Github pages for the repo to create publicly visible website
showcasing your work.

Provide links to all of the elements you have created (such as data
sets, functions, R package, video, presentation slides, …).

For the submission, push the index file, the docs folder and any of your
creations to the repository, and include a submission link in Canvas.
